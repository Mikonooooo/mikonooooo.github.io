I'm third-year undergraduate studying computer science at Cornell University.

I'm interested in the limits of theoretical computer science (cryptography, learning theory).

I have been a TA for algorithms and discrete math. I lead new member onboarding for the Cornell Data Science project team. I facilitated mastermind circles for goal-oriented Cornellians.

I post a few math videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@mikono2022). I enjoy anime and connecting with people.
