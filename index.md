I'm third-year undergraduate studying computer science at Cornell University.

I'm interested in the limits of theoretical computer science (cryptogaphy, learning theory).

I assist teaching the algorithms course. I onboard new members for my project team. I co-organize mastermind circles for goal-oriented Cornellians.

I post a few math videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@mikono2022). I enjoy anime and connecting with people.
