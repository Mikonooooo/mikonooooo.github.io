> "You don't know what you think until you write it."

Too much brainrot in society where we get numb and scroll.
Writing an essay is spending time with yourself. 
Give yourself time to really think about the thing, and form an opinion.
Synthesize new ideas, crystallize it's meaning to you.
I've done this for a few books and movies so far and they have worked immensely well
to not only help me remember what happened, but to also appreciate all the beauty and imperfection.

Here's what I've done so far.

The Handmaid and the Carpenter.

Brokeback Mountain.

Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.

The Virgin Suicides.

#### Summary
It makes me so happy that I'm doing this. And I hope to read and watch more over the summer.
