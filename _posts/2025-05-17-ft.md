Fortnite and first-person shooter games are generally looked down upon as infecting the minds of the youth with guns and violence. In particular, Fortnite is a serial offender for introducing and propogating gen alpha humor. And yet, my minds drifts back every now and then to the little chat message that appears when you exit the battle bus.

> "Mikono thanked the bus driver."

All 100 players would thank the bus driver. I was never told by anyone else to thank the bus driver, but from that point on, about 7th or 8th grade I started to thank bus drivers when leaving. Even now in college. I wonder if others had the same experience. 

Isn't it wonderful how video games can be used for encouraging genuinely good social behavior?

#### Summary
I learned to thank bus drivers from Fortnite.
