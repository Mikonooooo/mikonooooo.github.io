Do you feel stuck? Nothing you try works. When you fail, you recess into a corner.

It can feel incredibly lonely to be out there and fail over and over again. I have a quality of life update. You don't have to make public your entire life, but everyone needs a place to be heard, and be supported and be challenged. So I'm going to break it down in three steps. 

First, find a space that going to keep you accountable. Find people that will celebrate your wins, and challenge you when you are stuck. 

Second, make a connection with this group and be honest about your intentions and goals. This will help other people being able to fully support or challenge you.

Also, being honest about what you are struggling on is immensely powerful. The burden is no longer just on you, and the fact that you are talking about your challenges is already super noble and good progress. By talking about what you want and don't want and what works for you and what doesn't, you also gain a better understanding about what you want.
