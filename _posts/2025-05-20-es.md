If you understand something well enough, you can write it down. But the converse follows too.

> "You don't know what you think until you write it." -- paraphrased from Professor Dorit Abusch, Cornell Univesity

That doesn't mean you should write paragraphs and paragraphs for every single thing you will talk about. And don't just write essays to focus on the structure or a grade. Write for yourself and your understanding. And could you explain what your essay to someone else?

Recently, I've write about book and movies. These essays have not only helped me to remember the stories better, but they allow me to enjoy the unique qualities of what I'm experiencing. In a world filled with brain rot and doom scrolling, writing an essay has never been more refreshing! Just take a few minutes after finish a book, movie or video, and write about something.

Also, if you were looking for good movies or TV shows, here's a few recommendations:

**The Handmaid and the Carpenter** by Elizabeth Berg. (Novel, 2006) The meeting, marriange, and tribulations of Joseph and Mary, the parents of Jesus. They are passionately in love, but must deal with difference in values, tradition, and distrust stemming from the immaculate conception. A beautiful story regardless of your religious or political associations.

**Brokeback Mountain** by Annie Proulx. (Novel, 1997) The sexually-prolific affair between two poor, queer men in rural mid-western America who will never acknowledge their love. The language is gritty and vivid but to the point, and conveys all the happiness, melancholy, anger, and regret these characters have. Beware of a few curse words.

**Beetlejuice Beetlejuice** directed by Time Burton. (Movie, 2024) Sequel to _Beetlejuice_, follows the mending of a mother-daughter relationship, and a mother's escape from a manipulative boyfriend. The characters are vibrant, especially Michael Keaton's return as Beetlejuice, and you'll be amazed by the show-stopping final act. A Tim Burton classic, with all practical effects and colorful, gothic, Burton-esque vibes.

**The Virgin Suicides** directed by Sofia Coppola. (Movie, 1999) The ruin of the lives of 5 daughters, resulting in their suicides. Cast from the perspective of a group of lustful voyeurs (young boys) we see ignorance at all levels that prevents anyone from realizing what needs to be done. Beautifully, naturally shot, eriee, unsettling, and deeply disturbing.

#### Summary
It's so easy to scroll on your phone and become numb to living. Writing an essay is spending time with yourself to savor life and your personal experience. Don't write essays for a grade. Write essays for fun!
